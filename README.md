<b>Image MetaData Stripper v1.0</b>

Image MetaData Stripper is a lightweight and handy tool I wrote in two hours for stripping, cleaning and removing uncessary metadata from common image file formats (e.g. JPG or PNG). The image quality is _not_ altered in any way. You may drag and drop files to the window or open multiple files using a filedialog.

Why would you want to strip down an image file? Ask former TechTV host Cat Schwartz, who received a rather embarrassing lesson in 2003 about the power of metadata. In short, a cropped headshot posted on her blog contained an embedded, full-pic thumbnail with, well, a lot more than just a head and shoulders. Even if you're not cropping your mug out of a nude composition, there are others reasons you'd want to remove the metadata from an image. All sorts of information like exposure time, aperture settings, camera used, and GPS coordinates can potentially be embedded into an image.
This application just leaves the unaltered image behind. Whatever your motivation for sanitizing images is, you'll know that only the image itself remains.
